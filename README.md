## About The Project

This is a nice, small project to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM. Perfect for anyone who has learned the basics of JavaScript!

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Modern CSS3 (Flexbox, custom properties, mobile-first workflow)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for maintainable CSS
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, aria-live, keyboard-friendly interactions)
- Responsive design (optimized for 375px and larger viewports)

## What I learned

Through this project, I improved my understanding of writing clean, semantic HTML and organizing CSS with the BEM methodology.
I also practiced using the hidden attribute in combination with JavaScript for toggling UI states and refined my approach to building accessible, mobile-first layouts.
